# ToDoList-Project

For this project we had to do a web application which is a “ToDo List” for a class in order to organize homeworks and other appointements.
The students and the teachers have the access on this app but they don’t have the same rights. Indeed the teachers can create, 
edit and delete tasks while the students can only see the tasks to do.
We worked with servlets, java classes and jsp files. We used a database named ‘todolistdb’ that we created on MySQLWorkbench.
